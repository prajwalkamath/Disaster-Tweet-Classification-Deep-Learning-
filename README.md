# Disaster_Tweet_Classification-Deep-Learning-
Classifying live tweets from Twitter to decide whether a certain Tweet pertains to a real-life disaster or not and thus 
send aid to the affected place faster.



## Abstract:
Social media and twitter in particular has evolved into a sort of 
public forum where massive amounts of information is shared.
In todays digital world, news and live events are
broadcast all over social media in real time. Twitter has become
an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquity of smartphones enables people to announce an
emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more
and more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring
Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
The first-responders play an important role in any crisis and
with their help we can quickly send aid where its needed.
In this project we have compared various methods of classifying
disaster tweets namely, BERT transformer model, LSTM,
Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Random Forest model.
We find that the deep learning models perform better than the
machine learning models and BERT is found to perform the best.
By accurately and quickly predicting if a tweet is related to a
disaster or not we can send aid and disaster relief to the affected
site.

The folders are structured as follows:
1. Code:Preprocessing and Models,Bert
2. Dataset: The original datasets downloaded from Kaggle

## Steps to execute Code:

The code can be executed by just running each files in google colab , only dataset path have to be changed.
